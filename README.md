# Modern Node.js & Typescript starter

[![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)]()

This is a starter for speeding up the development process in creating modern Node.js apps using typescript. Modern Node.js allows us developers to use `ES6` features such as `import/export`, and the `async/await` keywords.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To get this starter running locally you will need:

- a node package manager (yarn or npm)
- a command line terminal (iTerm or bash)
- your favorite IDE (vscode, sublime)

### Installing

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RickBr0wn/modern-node-js-and-typescript-starter <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME> && cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
```

To start your own repository,

> **important:** make sure you are in the cloned directory.

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init

git add .
git commit -m 'initial commit'
```

This will remove the existing git history, and allow you to link it to a new repository.

> Please credit this starter if you build something fantastic!

## Built With

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) - As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.
- [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme) - Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env.`
- [nodemon](https://nodemon.io) - Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.
- [prettier](https://prettier.io) - Prettier is n opinionated code formatter, that supports many languages, integrates with most editors & has few options.
- [eslint](https://eslint.org) - ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. It is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your continuous integration pipeline.
- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
